## ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS - Package Published!

**Garnix Insights v0.1.0** is now live on crates.io!

### Install and Use
```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install garnix-insights

# Use CLI mode
garnix-insights <JWT_TOKEN> <COMMIT_ID>

# Use server mode  
garnix-insights server

# Use MCP mode
garnix-insights mcp
```

### Getting Your JWT Token

**Currently, the JWT token is only available through browser developer tools:**

1. **Login to Garnix.io**: Go to https://garnix.io and log in to your account
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Press F12 or right-click â†’ "Inspect Element"
3. **Go to Network Tab**: Click on the "Network" tab in developer tools
4. **Make an API Request**: Navigate around the Garnix.io site to trigger API calls
5. **Find API Request**: Look for requests to `api.garnix.io` in the network list
6. **Copy JWT from Cookie**: 
   - Click on any API request
   - Go to "Request Headers" section
   - Find the `Cookie` header
   - Copy the JWT value from the cookie

**Note**: This method is not ideal - I've reached out to the Garnix.io maintainers about providing a better solution for API access. Thanks to @lassulus for helping connect me with the team!
